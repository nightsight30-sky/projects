Here’s a summary of what you’ve done so far:

Set up the Repository:

Created a new local directory named git_branching.
Initialized a Git repository in it using git init.
Added the file Main.html and committed it with the message "main_code".
Linked the local repository to a remote GitHub repository using:
bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/nightsight30-sky/projects.git
Pushed the initial master branch to the remote repository.
Created Branches:

Created two new branches: branch1 and branch2.
branch1: Modified Main.html to add a Market column.
branch2: Modified Main.html to add a City column.
Made Changes in Each Branch:

Checked out each branch, made changes to Main.html, and committed the updates.
Merged Branches into Master:

Merged branch1 into master without issues.
Merged branch2 into master, encountered a merge conflict because both branches modified the same lines in Main.html.
Resolved the Merge Conflict:

Opened the conflicted file, Main.html, and manually resolved the conflict by choosing or merging the content.
Removed the conflict markers (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>) and finalized the file.
Staged the resolved file using git add Main.html and committed the resolution with the message "Resolved merge conflict in navigation links".
Successfully pushed the changes to the remote repository.
Current Repository State:

The master branch now contains the merged changes from both branch1 and branch2.
The repository reflects the resolved Main.html file and the successful merge of branches.
What’s Next?
You can clean up by deleting the merged branches (branch1 and branch2) if they are no longer needed:
bash
Copy code
git branch -d branch1
git branch -d branch2
git push origin --delete branch1 branch2
Optionally, add a README.md file to document your project.
